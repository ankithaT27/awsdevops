Steps to Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to set up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS services:

Step 1: Create a CodeCommit Repository
Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the CodeCommit console.
Create a new repository and clone it to your local machine.
Push your source code to the CodeCommit repository.
Step 2: Set Up CodeBuild
Create a build project in the CodeBuild console.

Configure the build project:

Source: Choose your CodeCommit repository.
Environment: Select the runtime environment, operating system, and the build specifications (e.g., runtime versions, build commands).
Define a buildspec.yml file in your source code repository to specify the build commands.


Set Up CodePipeline
Create a pipeline in the CodePipeline console.
Configure the pipeline settings:
Source: Choose your CodeCommit repository.
Build: Select the CodeBuild project.
Deploy: Choose the CodeDeploy application and deployment group.
Review and create the pipeline. This will trigger an initial run of the pipeline.
Step 5: Automate and Monitor
Push code changes to your CodeCommit repository to trigger the pipeline.
Monitor the pipeline in the CodePipeline console to view the progress and status of each stage.
Set up notifications using Amazon CloudWatch and SNS to get alerts on pipeline events and failures.
Example Pipeline Workflow
CodeCommit: Push code changes to the repository.
CodePipeline: Detects changes and starts the pipeline.
CodeBuild: Compiles the code, runs tests, and generates build artifacts.
CodeDeploy: Deploys the build artifacts to the specified environment.
Monitor and Notify: Monitor the deployment and set up notifications for success or failure.
